scat_lib documentation
======================

This is a python library with a collection of tools for X-ray scattering calculations developed at the Kirrander Group, University of Oxford. (https://kirrander.web.ox.ac.uk)

The library provides a wrapper for PyXSCAT library. It can compute X-ray scattering amplitudes (total and elastic) from ab initio calculations done by PySCF.

The library also provides a suite of tools in calculating scattering, in the gas phase, using the independent atom model.
